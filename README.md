Two tables showing boating accident data (one is from the Titanic). Boating is a popular recreational pastime in my area, and boating is very much ramping up right now. I wanted to convey that while boating is fun and can be very safe, that it is not without its risks. 
Boating data from the Bureau of Transportation was made using reactable so that anyone using the table can easily filter by their desired variable. Titanic data was made using kable because it gave a polished finish. but didn't neccessarily need as many pages as the "Boats" data. 
Formatting for both tables was mostly renaming variables.
